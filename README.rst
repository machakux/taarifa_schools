Taarifa Schools
===============

Background
__________

Taarifa_ is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and
triaging of infrastructure related issues. Think of it as a bug tracker
for the real world which helps to engage citizens with their local
government.

The Taarifa platform is built around the `Taarifa API`_, a RESTful
service offering that clients can interact with to create and triage
'bugreports' relating to public infrastructure (e.g., the public toilet
is broken).

For information on how to get inovoled, scroll to the Contributing section
at the bottom of the page.

This repository contains an example application around Schools
Management built on top of the core API.
